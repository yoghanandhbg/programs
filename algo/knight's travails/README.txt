 ORIGINAL KNIGHT'S TRAVAILS PROBLEM STATEMENT: Find the shortest possible path a Knight can take on a 8x8 chess board from
                                               given initial position to final position

THIS CODE SOLVES A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION OF THE PROBLEM:
  Simulate all the squares a knight can reach from a given square (without repeating already visited squares) in a infinite
black & white (chess-like) board - BFS traversal simulation.
